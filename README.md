* il.ff: Database of force field parameters for ions of several ionic
        liquids.  Format closely related to DLPOLY FIELD file.  The
        functional forms of bonds, angles, dihedrals correspond to the
        DLPOLY documentation.

* improperIm.dlp: "Improper" dihedrals for the aromatic ring in
                 imidazolium cations.  DLPOLY format, to include in
                 FIELD file.  Retrieved from AMBER paper JACS 117
                 (1995) 5179.

* improperIm.cfg: format for my own pre- and post-treatment tools.

* oplsaa.ff: Database of OPLS-AA force field parameters for some
            molecular compouds.  Format closely related to DL_POLY
            FIELD file.  Retrieved from several publications of the
            W.L. Jorgensen group.
